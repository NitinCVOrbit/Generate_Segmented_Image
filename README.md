# 🖼️ Image Segmentation Visualization with Overlay and Blending in Python  

🔴 **This project shows how to overlay and blend segmentation masks on images using Python, OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib.**  
You’ll learn how to create colored overlays for different classes, apply alpha blending, and visualize the final blended images for computer vision and deep learning tasks.

## 🚀 Features
- Upload and visualize your own images and masks  
- Apply class-specific colors to segmentation masks  
- Blend masks with the original image using OpenCV’s `addWeighted`  
- Visualize results in a grid with Matplotlib
